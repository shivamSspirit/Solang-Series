modulePartDescription: This section of Module 3 provides an in-depth exploration of code design and development of a flip program using Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) techniques in Solana, leveraging Solidity. The journey includes creating an interface in Solidity, writing tests in `TypeScript`, and culminates in building, deploying, and testing the flip program.

# Conclusion

Throughout this lesson, we have extensively examined the concept of composability in Web3, specifically focusing on its implementation in Solana using Solang, a Solidity-compatible compiler.

**Theoretical Aspects:**
- We explored cross-program invocation (CPI) and the process of initiating it using the `invoke` method. This included setting up the necessary instructions for the invocation.
- We delved into how Solang handles cross-program invocations, emphasizing the automatic generation of the `invoke` function by the Solang compiler.

**Practical Application:**
- We guided you through a practical example, creating a flip functionality to toggle power on and off. This demonstrated the application of CPI in a real-world scenario.

**Looking Ahead:**
- In upcoming modules, we will delve deeper into `invoke_signed`, which involves using Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs) for cross-program invocations. This will expand our understanding of more complex scenarios in Solana programming.
