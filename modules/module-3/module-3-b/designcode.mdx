modulePartDescription: In this section of Module 3, you'll delve into the practical aspects of coding, focusing on the development of a flip program using Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) techniques in Solana, leveraging Solidity. The process begins with creating an interface in Solidity, followed by writing tests in `TypeScript`, and then proceeding to build, deploy, and test the flip program.

## Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Develop the code for the CPI Flip program.
- Gain an understanding of implementing CPI in Solidity.

## tl;dr

This lesson provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and using Solang for Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) in Solana. It covers the initialization of the project and details the creation of two programs: a caller (`hand.sol`) and a callee (`lever.sol`). The caller program will interact with the callee through CPI. The lesson thoroughly explains the code for both programs and the handling of CPI in Solang, which simplifies the process compared to Anchor. This serves as a practical demonstration of composability in Solana and Solang for inter-program interactions.

## Overview

For our project setup, we'll follow the same system setup from previous articles, found [here](https://dev.to/shivamsspirit/minting-fungible-tokens-in-solana-using-solidity-solang-programming-languagepart-2-4lbc).

Start by initializing the project:

```bash
anchor init cpiinvoke --solidity
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cpiinvoke
```

And open it in VSCode:

```bash
code .
```

We'll use two Solidity files in the solidity directory: `hand.sol` (the caller) and `lever.sol` (the callee).

## Program Design

We're constructing a flip program with a simple purpose: to toggle power on or off using a boolean. This involves two programs: Program A (the caller) and Program B (the callee). Program A will call Program B using Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).

## Writing the Programs

### The Callee Program - `lever.sol`

Create `lever.sol` in the solidity directory and input the following code:

```Solidity
@program_id("J5J3mD4ABcRtB7YcgrJBgugiQAP3DfcZi5bSAdiMAZWh")
contract lever {
    // Switch state
    bool private isOn = true;

    @payer(payer)
    constructor() {}

    // Switch power on or off
    function switchPower(string name) public {
        // Toggling the switch
        isOn = !isOn;

        // Announcing the switch action
        print("{:} is pulling the power switch!".format(name));

        // Displaying current state
        if (isOn){
            print("The power is now on.");
        } else {
            print("The power is now off!");
        }
    }

    // Returning the switch state
    function get() public view returns (bool) {
        return isOn;
    }
}
```

This code sets up a switch mechanism, toggling the `isOn` state with `switchPower`. It includes a constructor and a `get` function to retrieve the current state.

### The Caller Program - `hand.sol`

In `hand.sol`, we create an interface to the lever program and set up the contract:

```Solidity
import "solana";

// Lever program interface
leverInterface constant leverProgram = leverInterface(address'J5J3mD4ABcRtB7YcgrJBgugiQAP3DfcZi5bSAdiMAZWh');
interface leverInterface {
    function switchPower(string name) external;
}

@program_id("7zJ7E8uZccmCH89eykH8yZsB6G685nbz7sSq8N9sZTtq")
contract hand {
    @payer(payer)
    constructor() {}

    function pullLever(address dataAccount, string name) public {
        AccountMeta[1] metas = [
            AccountMeta({pubkey: dataAccount, is_writable: true, is_signer: false})
        ];

        string instructionData = name;

        leverProgram.switchPower{accounts: metas}(instructionData);
    }
}
```

`hand.sol` uses an interface to interact with `lever.sol`. The `pullLever` function invokes the `switchPower` function in `lever.sol` using CPI.

### Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) in Solang

In Solang, CPI is simpler than in Anchor Rust. Using

 the syntax `<address>.call()`, a CPI is automatically constructed, and Solang takes care of `invoke` or `invoke_signed`.

### Up Next

In the upcoming lesson, we'll delve into writing tests for the CPI Flip program, exploring how to utilize `invoke_signed` for scenarios involving Program-Derived Addresses (PDA).
