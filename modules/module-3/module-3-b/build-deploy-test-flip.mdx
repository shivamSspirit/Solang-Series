modulePartDescription: In this section of Module 3, you'll engage in the practical development of a flip program, harnessing cross-program invocation techniques in Solana using Solidity. The process encompasses creating an interface in Solidity, writing tests in `TypeScript`, and ultimately building, deploying, and testing the flip program.

## Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Set up your program for the Solana Devnet.
- Generate a new wallet keypair and airdrop Solana Devnet tokens.
- Build and deploy your CPI Flip program to the Devnet.

## tl;dr

This lesson guides you through the steps to build and deploy your CPI Flip program to the Solana Devnet. It includes configuring your network cluster for the devnet, generating a new wallet keypair, and completing the build and deployment processes.

## Overview

### Building the Program

To begin, navigate to your `anchor.toml` file and switch the cluster to ***devnet***. Then, in your project's root directory, execute the following command to build the program:

```bash
anchor build
```

This command generates a target folder in the project root and compiles the Solana program, enabling client-side interaction through RPC methods.

### Deploying the Program

First, check your configuration:

```bash
solana config get
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

If needed, set your cluster to devnet:

```bash
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Then, generate a new keypair for your wallet:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

Verify your wallet address and balance:

```bash
solana address
solana balance
```

If you need Devnet SOL, airdrop tokens:

```bash
solana airdrop 4
```

To deploy, start a devnet cluster:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Then deploy your program:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

You should see a confirmation like this:

```bash
Deploying cluster: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Upgrade authority: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Deploying program "hand"...
Program path: ~/composability/cpi/target/deploy/hand.so...
Program Id: 7zJ7E8uZccmCH89eykH8yZsB6G685nbz7sSq8N9sZTtq

Deploying program "lever"...
Program path: ~/composability/cpi/target/deploy/lever.so...
Program Id: J5J3mD4ABcRtB7YcgrJBgugiQAP3DfcZi5bSAdiMAZWh

Deploy success
```

### Testing the Program

After deploying, update the program IDs in both your Solidity file and `anchor.toml` to match the newly deployed programs. The updated `anchor.toml` should look like this:

```bash
[features]
seeds = false
skip-lint = false

[programs.devnet]
hand = "7zJ7E8uZccmCH89eykH8yZsB6G685nbz7sSq8N9sZTtq"
lever="J5J3mD4ABcRtB7YcgrJBgugiQAP3DfcZi5bSAdiMAZWh"

[registry]
url = "https://api.apr.dev"

[provider]
cluster = "Devnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"

[scripts]
test = "yarn run ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/**/*.ts"
```

Rebuild the program:

```bash
anchor build
```

Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
yarn install
npm install
```

Finally, run tests:

```bash
anchor test
```

You should see results confirming the successful execution of your tests, indicating the program's correct functioning after CPI calls to toggle the power state.

```bash

This completes the lesson on building, deploying, and testing the CPI Flip program in Solana using Solidity and Solang. In the next lesson, we'll delve into further aspects of Solana development.
