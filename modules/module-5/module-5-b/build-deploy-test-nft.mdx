---

### Objectives

- Build the `pda-mint-authority` program.
- Deploy and test the minter program on Solana's Devnet.

### Overview

### Building the Program

To begin, navigate to your `anchor.toml` file and switch the cluster to **_devnet_**. Then, in your project's root directory, execute the following command to build the program:

```bash
anchor build
```

This command generates a target folder in the project root and compiles the Solana program, enabling client-side interaction through RPC methods.

### Deploying the Program

First, check your configuration:

```bash
solana config get
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```bash
Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

If needed, set your cluster to devnet:

```bash
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Then, generate a new keypair for your wallet:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

Verify your wallet address and balance:

```bash
solana address
solana balance
```

If you need Devnet SOL, airdrop tokens:

```bash
solana airdrop 4
```

To deploy, start a devnet cluster:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Then deploy your program:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

You should see a confirmation like this:

```bash
Deploying cluster: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Upgrade authority: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Deploying program "hand"...
Program path: ~/composability/cpi/target/deploy/hand.so...
Program Id: 7zJ7E8uZccmCH89eykH8yZsB6G685nbz7sSq8N9sZTtq

Deploying program "lever"...
Program path: ~/composability/cpi/target/deploy/lever.so...
Program Id: J5J3mD4ABcRtB7YcgrJBgugiQAP3DfcZi5bSAdiMAZWh

Deploy success
```

### Testing the Program

After deploying, update the program IDs in both your Solidity file and `anchor.toml` to match the newly deployed programs. The updated `anchor.toml` should look like this:

```bash
[features]
seeds = false
skip-lint = false

[programs.devnet]
hand = "7zJ7E8uZccmCH89eykH8yZsB6G685nbz7sSq8N9sZTtq"
lever="J5J3mD4ABcRtB7YcgrJBgugiQAP3DfcZi5bSAdiMAZWh"

[registry]
url = "https://api.apr.dev"

[provider]
cluster = "Devnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"

[scripts]
test = "yarn run ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/**/*.ts"
```

Rebuild the program:

```bash
anchor build
```

Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
yarn install
npm install
```

Finally, run tests:

```bash
anchor test
```

You should see results confirming the successful execution of your tests, indicating the program's correct functioning after CPI calls to toggle the power state.

```bash
spl-token-minter

### Inspect on Solana explorer

Find your program's wallet address using solana address and view its details on [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet)

The Solana explorer provides us with important information about the deployed program and the wallet like balance transactions and token holdings. To see our minted tokens, click on Tokens, then the result should be as shown below:

Search and find out the minted tokens with the title Solana Pro that have 159 GM supply. Clicking on it will a result as shown below:

### Conclusion

You have successfully built, deployed, and tested a Solidity-based NFT minting program on Solana's Devnet. This process included setting up the development environment, managing wallet and cluster configurations, and deploying the program. By running tests and verifying the results on Solana Explorer, you have gained practical experience in blockchain development with Solana and Solidity. This marks an important step in your journey as a blockchain developer, paving the way for more advanced applications and dApp integrations. Congratulations on your progress!
