# lession 1: solang concept related to this module

1. contract.
2. why we re-implement library methods(i think because of signing with pda(also in library methods mint authority is different)).
3. pda-derivation(which method we will use for pda derivation(findprogramsync))
4. seeds , payer , bump

### Metadata[](https://docs.metaplex.com/guides/archived/architecture/deep_dive/overview#metadata)

This object can be used to provide basic info about SPL tokens on Solana, which include the name, symbol, URI and seller fees, as well as whether the sale of this metadata has happened yet. Anybody carrying a token from this mint can mark this primary sale as having happened via the `update_primary_sale_happened_via_token` command. There is obviously no incentive for a primary owner to do this as it precludes them from getting full royalties on the first sale, but a secondary owner must do this if they ever want to see fees from selling!

Metadata accounts are simply PDA addresses with derived key of `['metadata', token_metadata_program_id, mint_id]`.

its possible to do the equivalent of invoke_signed in solang, but you have to manually write out the instruction and have to know the implementation of the program you're invoking to get the instruction data correct. Here's an example of invoking the token program using a PDA as the mint authority

and then cpi via invoke would just be like the examples included in the spl token library,

here's the one for invoking the token program to mint tokens

## **Mint Accounts**

When someone wants to create a new token, he uses the `create-token` function to initialize a new *Mint Account*, which contains basic information about the token: The `mint-authority` which is a public-key (*pubkey*) authorized to mint this token, the `freeze-authority` who can freeze token accounts (to be described below), and some additional data as the total `supply` of the token, the number of `decimals`, and the `isInitialized` flag. This account stores general information about the token and who has permissions over it. Observe that there is no data about token holdings of particular individuals. These are stored in *Token Accounts*.

## **Token Accounts**

The *token account* holds information about the tokens owned by a *pubkey*. Ownership relationships become a bit confusing, though. The token account itself is owned by the Token program and it is the Token program who controls access to these tokens using the `owner`, `close-authority` and `delegate` fields within the account. The `owner` is the *pubkey* who can spend/transfer the tokens, the `close-authority` can close the account, and the `owner` can give rights to a `delegate` *pubkey* to spend up to a `delegatedAmount` of tokens. Besides these fields, there are also a few flags: `isInitialized`, `isFrozen`, `isNative`. By default, token accounts are initialized upon creation, are not frozen and are not native. Previously, we saw the mint account defines a `freeze-authority`, who has the right to freeze the tokens in a user account. Often times, the `freeze-authority` is null (all zeroes). In that case, no one can freeze the corresponding tokens held in the token account.

## solang contracts

As the underlying Solana environment is different than that of Ethereum, Solidity inner workings have been modified to function properly. For example, A Solidity contract on Solana utilizes two accounts: a data account and a program account. The program account stores the contract’s executable binary and owns the data account, which holds all the storage variables. On Ethereum a single account can store executable code and data.

the data layout from a new contract is compatible with that of an old one, it is possible to update the binary in the program account and retain the same data, rendering contract upgrades implemented in Solidity unnecessary. Solana’s CLI tool provides a command to both do an initial deploy of a program, and redeploy it later.:

`solana program deploy --program-id <KEYPAIR_FILEPATH> <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>`

where `<KEYPAIR_FILEPATH>` is the program’s keypair json file and `<PROGRAM_FILEPATH>` is the program binary `.so` file. For more information about redeploying a program, check [Solana’s documentation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/deploy-a-program#redeploy-a-program).

# **Setting the payer, seeds, bump, and space for a contract**

When a contract is instantiated, there are two accounts required: the program account to hold the executable code and the data account to save the state variables of the contract. The program account is deployed once and can be reused for updating the contract. When each Solidity contract is instantiated (also known as deployed), the data account has to be created. This can be done by the client-side code, and then the created blank account is passed to the transaction that runs the constructor code.

Alternatively, the data account can be created by the constructor, on chain. When this method is used, some parameters must be specified for the account using annotations. Annotations placed above a constructor can only contain literals or constant expressions, as is the case for first `@seed` and `@space` in the following example. Annotations can also refer to constructor arguments when placed next to them, as the second `@seed` and the `@bump` examples below. The `@payer` annotation is a special annotation that [declares an account](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.3/targets/solana.html#account-management).

If the contract has no constructor, annotations can be paired with an empty constructor.

```Solidity
@program_id("Foo5mMfYo5RhRcWa4NZ2bwFn4Kdhe8rNK5jchxsKrivA")
contract Foo {

    @space(500 + 12)
    @seed("Foo")
    @payer(payer)
    constructor(@seed bytes seed_val, @bump bytes1 bump_val) {
        // ...
    }
}
```


Creating an account needs a payer, so at a minimum the `@payer` annotation must be specified. If it is missing, then the data account must be created client-side. The `@payer` annotation [declares a Solana account](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.3/targets/solana.html#account-management) that must be passed in the transaction.

The size of the data account can be specified with `@space`. This is a `uint64` expression which can either be a constant or use one of the constructor arguments. The `@space` should at least be the size given when you run `solang -v`:

`$ solang compile --target solana -v examples/solana/flipper.sol
...
info: contract flipper uses at least 17 bytes account data
...`

If the data account is going to be a [program derived address](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses), then the seeds and bump have to be provided. There can be multiple seeds, and an optional single bump. If the bump is not provided, then the seeds must not create an account that falls on the curve. When placed above the constructor, the `@seed` can be a string literal, or a hex string with the format `hex"4142"`. If before an argument, the seed annotation must refer to an argument of type `bytes`, `address`, or fixed length byte array of `bytesN`. The `@bump` must a single byte of type `bytes1`.

## PDA derivation

### **Builtin try_find_program_address**

This function returns the program derived address for a program address and the provided seeds, along with a seed bump. See the Solana documentation on [program derived addresses](https://edge.docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses).

**import** {try_find_program_address} **from** 'solana';


```Solidity
contract pda {
    address token = address"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA";

    function create_pda(bytes seed2) public returns (address, bytes1) {
        **return** try_find_program_address(["kabang", seed2], token);
    }
}
```

### **Accessing accounts’ data**

Accounts declared on a constructor using the `@payer` annotation are available for access inside it. Likewise, accounts declared on external functions with any of the aforementioned annotations are also available in the `tx.accounts` vector for easy access. For an account declared as `@account(funder)`, the access follows the syntax `tx.accounts.funder`, which returns the [AccountInfo builtin struct](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.3/targets/solana.html#account-info).

## Annotations And Constructor

Annotations placed above a constructor can only contain literals or constant expressions, as is the case for first `@seed` and `@space` in the following example. Annotations can also refer to constructor arguments when placed next to them, as the second `@seed` and the `@bump` examples below. The `@payer` annotation is a special annotation that [declares an account](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.3/targets/solana.html#account-management).
