# lession 1: intro for what we discuss in this module

# **Objective**

In this lesson, you will learn the creation of Solana NFTs using Solidity. You will also receive a bird's-eye overview of what we are building.

## Overview

In the previous section, we discussed Solana programs and how they work, introduced Invoke CPI. Now, let's dive into composability. We'll guide you in understanding Solana NFTs and the process of creating them, known as minting.

We'll also talk about Metaplex and explain the concept of PDAs. You'll discover how PDAs work in Solana and how CPI invoke_signed uses them. After that, we'll guide you through creating a program for the NFT minter. In this program, we'll use CPI invoke_signed and PDAs with Solang Solidity.

## **Prerequisites**

**Prior to proceeding, it is recommended to have reviewed the previous modules in this course.**
