## Objective

In this lesson, you'll embark on an exciting journey to understand and create Solana Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using Solidity. We'll give you a comprehensive overview of the entire process.

## Overview

After gaining insights into Solana programs and Invoke CPI in previous sections, it's time to explore the world of Solana NFTs and the concept of composability. This lesson will serve as your guide to:

- Understanding the nuances of Solana NFTs and the minting process.
- Learning about Metaplex, a pivotal framework in Solana's NFT ecosystem.
- Grasping the functionality of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and their role in Solana.
- Delving into how CPI invoke_signed is utilized with PDAs.
- Creating a Solidity-based NFT minter program on Solana, implementing CPI invoke_signed and PDAs.

## Prerequisites

Before moving forward, make sure you're comfortable with the content covered in the previous modules. A solid understanding of Solana's basic concepts, programming model, and Solidity's role in this environment is crucial for grasping the more advanced topics we'll be discussing.
