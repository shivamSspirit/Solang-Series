## Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Build your SPL-Token-Minter program.
- Deploy and test the program on the Solana network.

## tl;dr

This lesson covers the stages of building, deploying, and testing your SPL-Token-Minter program. It begins with building the program, then discusses connecting your wallet to the devnet and airdropping testnet tokens. After building, you'll learn to initiate a new Solana devnet cluster and deploy your program. Finally, you'll test the deployed program and verify its success through the transaction signature in Solana Explorer.

## Overview

### Build

To build your project, open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and run:

```bash
anchor build
```

This compiles your project, creating a `target` folder in the root directory with the IDL and types needed to interact with your Solana program using RPC methods.

### Deploy 

Start by checking your configuration:

```bash
solana config get
```

You should see an output like this:

```bash
Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

For the Devnet, note the RPC URL and the location of your wallet's keypair. Ensure you have a wallet keypair for deployment. Set the cluster to Devnet with:

```bash
solana

config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Generate a new keypair with this command:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

Now, check your wallet's address and balance:

```bash
solana address
solana balance
```

If you lack Devnet SOL, airdrop some to your wallet:

```bash
solana airdrop <amount>
```

With sufficient SOL, you're set to deploy your program. Start a Solana devnet cluster:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Then, deploy your program:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

You'll see a confirmation like this:

```bash
Deploying cluster: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Upgrade authority: ~.config/solana/id.json
Deploying program "spl_token_minter"...
Program path: ~/Desktop/demo/spl-token-minter/target/deploy/spl_token_minter.so...
Program Id: 3iCbv94ivHb4of8NEeikMbk2kckLVSDmUEprpQZ1cBUw
Deploy success
```

Your program is now on the Devnet. Record the program ID and update it in your Solidity file and `anchor.toml`.

Rebuild the program:

```bash
anchor build
```

### Test

Ensure testing dependencies are installed:

```bash
yarn install
```

Test your program:

```bash
anchor test
```

The output should confirm successful tests:

```bash
spl-token-minter
...
3 passing (12s)
```

To see your minted tokens on Solana Explorer, get your wallet address:

```bash
solana address
```

Visit [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) and search with your wallet address. You'll see an overview of your wallet:

For token details, click on Tokens:

Find the "Solana Pro" tokens with a supply of ***159 GM***:

This section displays all the information about your minted tokens.

You have now successfully built, deployed, and tested tokens on Solana using Solidity and Solang. This completes the lesson on creating and managing a fungible token program on the Solana blockchain. With these steps, you've gained hands-on experience in the key aspects of blockchain development, including program deployment and token minting.
