# Overview

In this module, we embarked on an explorative journey into the realm of Solana program development through the lens of Solidity. The module was carefully crafted to demystify the nuances of Solidity programs on Solana, contrasting them with their Ethereum counterparts.

Structured in a reader-friendly format, the module was divided into well-defined sections to ensure a coherent and systematic understanding of the topic.

We began with an introductory section aimed at building a foundational understanding of Solidity programs on Solana. This part elaborated on various facets of Solana blockchain development, emphasizing the use of Solidity through Solang.

The subsequent sections provided a practical, hands-on approach. Here, we delved into the step-by-step process of creating a "spl-token-minter" program using Solidity. This practical exercise was pivotal in translating theoretical knowledge into real-world application, equipping readers with the skills to implement the concepts learned.

Moving forward, the next module in the series will shift the focus to developing a Flip program. This will involve leveraging advanced features like **CPI (Cross-Program-Invocation)** and **PDA (Program Derived Address)** within the Solidity (Solang) framework. This progression ensures a comprehensive and expanding learning experience, further enriching the educational journey through this series.
