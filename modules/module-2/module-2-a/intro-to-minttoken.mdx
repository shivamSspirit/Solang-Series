# Objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Build an SPL token minter program using Solidity within the Anchor framework.
- Develop a functional on-chain program for the Solana blockchain.
- Get hands-on experience in creating and minting fungible tokens on Solana.

## tl;dr

Dive into the world of Solana and Solidity to create an **SPL-token-minter** program. This practical guide will lead you through the process of developing an on-chain program for Solana, known for its low transaction fees and rapid confirmation times. You'll gain valuable experience in token creation and minting on the Solana blockchain using Solidity.

# Detailed Overview

This module offers an in-depth exploration of building a token minter program on Solana, utilizing the Solidity programming language and the Anchor framework. Key points include:

- **Understanding SPL Token Minter**: Learn the fundamentals of SPL (Solana Program Library) token minting, focusing on how to use Solidity in the Solana ecosystem.

- **Anchor Framework Utilization**: Anchor is a framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime, providing tools and libraries to develop efficient, secure, and composable on-chain programs. You'll learn how to integrate Solidity with Anchor to create your SPL token minter.

- **Hands-on Token Creation and Minting**: The practical aspect involves setting up your development environment, writing the Solidity code for the token minter, and deploying it to the Solana blockchain. This hands-on approach will solidify your understanding of the token-minting process.
The project's code is accessible in the [spl_token_minter](https://github.com/shivamSspirit/mintgoldtoken/)

In the next section, we'll set up your development environment.
