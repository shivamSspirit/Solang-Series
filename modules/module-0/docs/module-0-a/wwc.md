# what we will cover

## Objectives

We will cover all aspects of building on Solana using Solidity.

## tl;dr

Let us understand the building blocks of Solana and Solidity and build cool things together.

# Overview

- Learn how to develop Solana programs using Solidity.
- Understand how Solidity works in Solana.
- Gain an understanding of the core components of Solana, including accounts, programs, transactions, instructions, CPI, and PDA.

Discover the process of creating and building Solana programs with ease through our course. Our course is designed to help you understand by following along with examples and demos, reading stories, and watching animations. Moreover, you can build sample projects that we will work on throughout the course.
