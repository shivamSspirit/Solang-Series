# Objectives

In this lesson, we will explore the essential prerequisites that must be met before commencing the course.

## tl;dr

This lesson outlines the fundamental prerequisites for the course. Participants are expected to possess basic programming skills, a working knowledge of Git and GitHub, and more. The structure of the course material is also discussed in this section.

# Overview

## Prerequisites

Participants are required to have a foundational understanding of programming, a basic grasp of Solidity development and TypeScript, as well as familiarity with the fundamentals of Git. Additionally, you should possess qualities like perseverance and the ability to independently seek solutions to problems.
Previous experience in blockchain development or related course subjects is not mandatory.
How much programming experience is necessary? You should be reasonably proficient in your chosen programming language. Typically, achieving this level of proficiency takes at least 100-200 hours of practice.

## Reading Order

The course material is designed to be consumed one section at a time, following the prescribed order. The content includes comprehensive overviews of concepts and practical narratives that provide ample information for coding alongside demonstrations. While you may perform the demos as you encounter them in the material, it is highly advantageous to read the material before embarking on the coding exercises.
Throughout the course, you will be constructing a comprehensive application piece by piece, across multiple sections. Some demo applications will be developed over several parts. It is strongly recommended to actively participate in the coding process while making small, independent modifications. Example application code can be found on GitHub.

## Course Structure

The course comprises eight parts, with the initial section labeled as "0" to maintain consistency with prior iterations. Each part is designed to correspond to approximately half a week of study, typically requiring 6-9 hours. However, the duration and pace at which you complete the course are flexible.
We discourage progression to the next section without a solid understanding of the preceding topics. The course follows the principles of [Mastery Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning), and you are only encouraged to proceed to the next part once you have sufficiently engaged with the exercises in the previous section.
Completion of the demos developed in parts 1-7 is an expected component of your journey, as they significantly contribute to your final projects.

## Before You Start

Before you embark on this course, please keep the following in mind:

- This course serves as a crash course in Solidity on Solana.
- We do not delve deeply into every Solidity concept.
- Our primary focus is on teaching you how to build on the Solana platform.
- We emphasize the visualization of Solana concepts over Solidity.
- It is crucial to thoroughly verify all system requirements and installations before initiating the course.
