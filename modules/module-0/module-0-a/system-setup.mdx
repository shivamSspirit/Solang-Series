## **Objective**

*By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:*

- Set up your system for Solana development using Solidity.
- Install the required tools and technologies for this course, enabling you to build and experiment with the examples provided.

## tl;dr

This quickstart guide will walk you through installing and setting up your local development environment. Get ready to start developing and deploying Solana Solidity programs on the blockchain.

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to install and set up the system for local Solana development, including Backend, CLI, Client, Rust, Anchor, Solana tools, and JavaScript. This setup is primarily for macOS and Linux users. For Windows users, please refer to [Solana Windows Setup](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects/blob/main/Solana_And_Web3/en/Section_2/Resources/windows_setup.md).

- Understanding System Pre-requisites
- Completing Checkpoint One
- Installing The Solana CLI
- Installing the Anchor Framework
- Completing Checkpoint Two
- Creating a FileSystem Wallet
- Airdropping Devnet SOL tokens
- Installing and Configuring Solang
- Installing Solang VSCode Extension
- Setting up a localhost blockchain cluster
- Client-side setup

## The System Pre-Requisites

1. **Node.js** - Essential for JavaScript runtime. 
   - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

2. **Rust** - Used for compiling Solidity into Solana bytecode format.
   - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. **Yarn** - A package manager for your code.
   - [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

## Checkpoint One

**Verify your installation by running these commands:**

```bash
rustc --version
node --version
yarn --version
cargo --version
```

Expected output:

```bash
rustc 1.70.0
v17.8.0
1.22.19
cargo 1.70.0
```

## Install the Solana CLI

- Follow the instructions based on your operating system at the [Solana

Cookbook Installation Guide](https://solanacookbook.com/getting-started/installation.html#install-cli). For MacOS and Linux:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/LATEST_RELEASE/install)"
```

Replace `LATEST_RELEASE` with the desired version or use a symbolic channel name like `stable`, `beta`, or `edge`. Confirm the installation with:

```bash
solana --version
```

## Install Anchor Framework

Anchor is crucial for Solana development. Install it using the Anchor version manager (avm) for easier management:

- [Install Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

## Checkpoint Two

Check your installations:

```bash
solana --version
anchor --version
```

Expected output:

```bash
solana-cli 1.17.3
anchor-cli 0.29.0
```

## Create FileSystem Wallet

Create a Solana wallet for deploying programs:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

Set this wallet as default:

```bash
solana config set -k ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

## Airdrop Devnet SOL tokens

Airdrop SOL tokens for testing:

```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

Check your balance:

```bash
solana balance
```

## Install and Configure Solang

Solang compiles Solidity for Solana. Ensure it's correctly installed:

```bash
solang --version
```

## Install Solang VSCode Extension

Enhance your development experience with the Solang VSCode Extension.

## Setup a localhost blockchain cluster

Run a local Solana blockchain cluster for development:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Configure Solana CLI for localhost:

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

## Client side setup

#### **Install Web3.js**

For JavaScript or TypeScript development on Solana, use the `@solana/web3.js` library:

```bash
yarn add @solana/web3.js
```

- **SPL-Token**: For interacting with SPL tokens:

```bash
yarn add @solana/spl-token
```

- **Wallet-Adapter**: To integrate wallets like Phantom and Solflare:

```bash
yarn add @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets @solana/wallet-adapter-base
```

With these steps, you are now fully equipped to embark on your Solana development journey using Solidity. This setup provides you with the essential tools and frameworks needed to build, test, and deploy your applications on the Solana blockchain. 

Remember, the world of blockchain development is dynamic and constantly evolving. Keep exploring and experimenting with different tools and techniques to enhance your skills and understanding. Happy coding!
