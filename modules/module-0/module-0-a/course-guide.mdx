## tl;dr

In this lesson, we go through an overview of the content of the course and learn how to utilise it to its maximum potential.

## **Welcome**

Greetings, newcomers and developers! Welcome to an intensive crash course in Solana development using Solidity. This course provides an ideal entry point to acquaint yourself with the Solana ecosystem where we delve into Solidity on Solana, and collaboratively embark on exciting projects.

## **Course Overview**

**What Is This Course About?**

This course is tailored for Ethereum developers, beginners, and enthusiasts. It offers comprehensive coverage of Solana blockchain development using Solidity. You will acquire the skills to create decentralized applications with Solidity on Solana, JSON-RPC, and master client-side interaction with Solana programs using React.js. Moreover, you will become adept at building Solana programs with Solidity.

## **What You Will Learn in This Course**

**Throughout this course, you will:**

1. Gain a profound understanding of how Solidity integrates within the Solana blockchain ecosystem.
2. Explore the Solang SDK and its role in compiling Solidity contracts into a format compatible with Solana.
3. Conduct a comparative analysis of Solidity development on Solana versus Solidity on Ethereum.
4. Master Solana-compatible Solidity for seamless deployment on the Solana blockchain.
5. Develop a comprehensive grasp of core Solana concepts, including accounts, programs, transactions, instructions, CPI, and PDA.
6. Conceive and construct a Solidity Solana program for minting Solana Gold tokens (SPL tokens).
7. Explore the concept of composability within Solana programs, illustrated through the creation of a flip program using CPI.
8. Learn to develop Solana programs and achieve the capability to transfer your minted Gold SPL tokens to another person's ATA.
9. Hone your skills in minting and selling NFTs through program development using PDA and CPI invoke signed.
10. Create a fully realized full-stack dApp for the minting and transfer of Gold tokens.
11. Engineer an extensive full-stack dApp for the minting and sale of NFTs.
12. Conclude the course by undertaking a substantial project, applying the knowledge and skills acquired.

## **Course Structure**

The course comprises eight modules, each dedicated to a specific topic. Every lesson starts with a clear outline of its objectives, providing a preview of the lesson's content.

Each lesson consists of two parts:

- **Overview -** A concise introduction to the lesson's content, offering an initial understanding of the topic.
- **Demo -** A tutorial-style project related to the lesson's content, designed to reinforce your understanding.

The course content is thoughtfully divided to facilitate easy comprehension.

## **Maximizing Your Learning**

This course material is designed to be consumed sequentially, one part at a time.
The material includes demos, placed so that preceding material furnishes adequate information for building each project. You can choose to build the demos as you encounter them in the material, or you may find it beneficial to read the entire material within a part before commencing with the demo.
In many parts of the course, the demos collectively build one larger application, piece by piece. Some demo applications evolve over several parts.
Progressing from one part to the next is advisable only after achieving a sufficient understanding of the topics covered in the first part. The course employs the principles of Mastery Learning, allowing you to advance to the next part after successfully completing the exercises in the previous part.
