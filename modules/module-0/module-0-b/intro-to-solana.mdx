# Objective

In this lesson, you will learn to:

- Introduce Solana to developers experienced in Ethereum.
- Highlight the advantages of Solana in comparison to Ethereum.

## tl;dr

This lesson serves as an introduction to Solana for Ethereum developers, paving the way to understand why Solana is an increasingly popular choice for developing blockchain applications.

# Overview

Solana is a high-speed, efficient blockchain platform tailored for decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrencies. By integrating cutting-edge technology, Solana achieves remarkable scalability and swift transaction processing.

As one of the fastest and most cost-effective public blockchains globally, Solana distinguishes itself with its speed and economic efficiency.

In contrast to Ethereum's single-threaded execution and EOS's WebAssembly (WASM)-based runtimes, Solana introduces an innovative approach named Sealevel. This advanced smart contract runtime system is capable of handling thousands of contracts simultaneously. It optimizes the Validator's infrastructure, thereby significantly boosting Solana's overall performance.

In the next lesson, we will delve deeper into the Solana blockchain, exploring why it is becoming a preferred platform for blockchain development compared to other options.
