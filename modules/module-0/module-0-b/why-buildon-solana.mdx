# Objective

This lesson aims to elucidate why blockchain developers might opt for Solana, focusing on:

- Diverse Smart Contract Capabilities
- Scalability and Performance
- Community Support and Growth Potential

## tl;dr

This lesson discusses the advantages of building on Solana, including its support for multiple programming languages for smart contracts, such as Rust, C, C++, Python, and Solidity. Solana stands out with its vast community, low transaction costs, and significantly higher transaction speed compared to Ethereum. The following lesson will cover Solidity for developing Ethereum and Solana-compatible decentralized applications (dApps).

## Overview

### Entering the Solana Ecosystem

For newcomers to Solana, the platform is welcoming, even for those with limited experience in smart contracts or blockchain technology.

Solana's smart contracts function as programs that can be created in various programming languages. This includes Rust (native and via Anchor), C, C++, Python (through Seahorse), and the newly added Solidity (utilizing Solang and Anchor) for deploying programs on the blockchain.

Joining the Solana community, you'll be part of a network with over 11 million active accounts (as of August 2023), a thriving environment that has seen the minting of more than 21 million NFTs at an average transaction cost of just $0.00025. Solana's transaction throughput is an impressive 4,386 transactions per second (tps), a stark contrast to Ethereum's 24.02 tps.

Solana offers a wealth of tools and resources, ensuring a smooth entry into the realm of blockchain development on its platform.

## The Ecosystem

The Solana ecosystem is a dynamic and innovative hub in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The Solana blockchain, known for its rapid transaction speeds and low fees, is ideal for decentralized applications and DeFi platforms. Its Proof of History consensus mechanism enables scalability and high transaction throughput.
