# Objective

In this lesson, we will delve into the process of transferring Solana tokens using Solidity.

## tl;dr

Having covered various aspects of Solana programs in our previous module, including how Solana programs operate and the use of Invoke CPI for creating switch power programs, we now turn our focus to the practical application of these concepts. This module specifically concentrates on transferring a gold token to another associated token account utilizing the Invoke CPI method.

# Overview

Our journey through the previous modules has established a solid foundation in understanding the integration of Solana's high-performance blockchain with Solidity. We've learned to build smart contracts and facilitate cross-program invocations (CPI) with ease.

In this module, we'll explore Cross-Program Invocation in detail. Our primary goal is to develop a program that can transfer tokens between different accounts using CPI. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a thorough understanding of token transfer processes and composability in Solana programming.

## Prerequisites

Before moving forward, it's recommended to review the previous articles in this series for a comprehensive understanding. These can be found at [Solang Series](/).
