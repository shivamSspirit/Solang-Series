modulePartDescription: In this section of Module 4, we will focus on enhancing the previously developed token minter program by incorporating the functionality to transfer minted tokens to another account through Cross-Program Invocation (CPI). This will include steps to build, deploy, and test the updated program.

## Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Build the enhanced spl-token-minter program.
- Deploy and test the upgraded program.

## tl;dr

This lesson covers the process of building the upgraded spl-token-minter program. After successfully building the program, it guides you through the steps of connecting your wallet to the devnet, airdropping testnet tokens, and deploying the program. Subsequently, we test the deployed program to ensure its functionality.

## Overview

### Building the Program

Start by opening your project's root directory in the terminal and enter:

```bash
anchor build
```

This command generates a target folder in the project root and compiles idl and types of our Solana program for client-side interaction using RPC methods. Next, verify your configuration:

### Deploying the Program

```bash
solana config get
```

The expected output should be:

```bash
Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

Set your cluster to devnet:

```bash
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

Generate a new wallet keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

Check your wallet address and balance:

```bash
solana address
solana balance
```

If necessary, airdrop Devnet SOL:

```bash
solana airdrop 4
```

Begin the deployment process:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Deploy your program:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

You should see a deployment confirmation:

```bash
Deploying cluster: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Upgrade authority: ~/.config/solana/id.json
Deploying program "spl_token_minter"...
Program path: /path/to/your/project/target/deploy/spl_token_minter.so...
Program Id: <Your Program ID>

Deploy success
```

Update the program IDs in both your Solidity file and `anchor.toml` file with the new IDs. Rebuild the program:

```bash
anchor build
```

### Testing the Program

Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
yarn install
npm install
```

Run the tests:

```bash
anchor test
```

The output should indicate the success of the tests:

```bash
spl-token-minter

This completes the process of building, deploying, and testing the upgraded spl-token-minter program. The successful tests confirm the program's ability to transfer tokens effectively within the Solana ecosystem.

In the next lesson, we will explore additional aspects of Solana's development, further enhancing our understanding and skills.
