## Conclusion

As we conclude our module on "How to Transfer Solana Tokens with Solidity," we've built upon our understanding of cross-program invocation (CPI) by delving into the intricacies of Solana token transfers. A key takeaway from this module is the significance of Associated Token Accounts (ATAs) in facilitating token transfers on the Solana network.

We applied this knowledge practically by conducting a transfer using the CPI method for the Gold Tokens that we previously minted in our SPL Token program. This practical implementation provided hands-on experience with the Solana ecosystem and its token transfer mechanisms.

As we look ahead to the next module, we will explore the concept of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and their applications within the Solana framework.
