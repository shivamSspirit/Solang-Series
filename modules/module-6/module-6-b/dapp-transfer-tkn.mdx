## Transferring SPL Tokens

We'll now explore how to transfer SPL tokens to another user. Start by opening the `TransferToken.tsx` component file in your project.

As before, you'll see steps for importing necessary elements and setting up the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for creating the Program API. This setup is crucial for making RPC (Remote Procedure Call) transfers.

## Initiating a Web3 Transaction

First, we start a new transaction using Solana's Web3.js:

```tsx
const transaction = new web3.Transaction();
```

## Gathering User Input

Next, we collect user input for the following:

- `mint account`: The account of the token to be transferred.
- `recipientPubKey`: The public key of the recipient.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens to be transferred.

We adjust the amount to account for the smallest token divisions (lmports):

```tsx
const mintPubKey = new web3.PublicKey(event.target.mint.value);
const recipientPubKey = new web3.PublicKey(event.target.recipient.value);
let amount = event.target.amount.value;
amount = amount * 10 ** 9; // Adjusting for lmports
```

## Creating Associated Token Accounts (ATAs)

We need to create ATAs for both the sender and the recipient, using the same token mint:

```tsx
const senderAta = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(
    mintPubKey,
    publicKey,
    false,
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);

const receiverAta = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(
    mintPubKey,
    recipientPubKey,
    false,
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);
```

## Handling the ATA Transaction

Next, we check if the receiver's ATA exists and, if not, add an instruction to create it:

```tsx
try {
    await getAccount(connection, receiverAta);
} catch (e) {
    transaction.add(
        createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
            publicKey,
            receiverAta,
            recipientPubKey,
            mintPubKey,
            TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
            ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
        )
    );
}
```

## Making the Transfer RPC Call

Finally, we set up the RPC call to transfer tokens using the contract's methods:

```tsx
const transferTx = await program.methods
    .transferTokens(amount)
    .accounts({
        from: senderAta,
        to: receiverAta,
        owner: publicKey,
    })
    .instruction();

transaction.add(transferTx);

const signature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);

await connection.confirmTransaction(signature, "confirmed");
```

And that wraps up our module on minting and transferring SPL tokens in a DAppâ€”from the frontend to the backend.

Stay tuned for more on client-contract interactions in the next module!
