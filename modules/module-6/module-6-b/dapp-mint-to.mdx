## Minting Tokens to the Minter's Wallet

Let's mint tokens directly to the Minter's Wallet. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to the "MintTo" component in your project.
2. In this component, you'll see familiar steps from earlier, like importing necessary elements and setting up the IDL for creating the Program API. This setup is used to make RPC calls for minting tokens.

When you use the "`mintTo`" function, it starts by getting a mint key from the user through a form. This mint key comes from the token the user minted.

Additionally, you take the token amount the user enters and adjust it for the smallest fractions of the token (called lmports). For example:

```tsx
let amount = event.target.amount.value;
amount = amount * 10 ** 9; // 10^9 lmports (fractions) of that token
```

## Creating an Associated Token Account (ATA)

Next, we create an Associated Token Account (ATA) for the minter using their wallet's public key.

```tsx
const associatedToken = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(
    mintPubKey,
    publicKey,
    false,
    TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
    ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);
```

## Setting Up the RPC Call

Now, we set up the RPC call to mint tokens into the userâ€™s ATA.

```tsx
const createMint = await program.methods
    .mintTo(amount)
    .accounts({
        mint: mintPubKey,
        tokenAccount: associatedToken,
        mintAuthority: publicKey,
    })
    .rpc({ skipPreflight: true });
```

In this phase, we use the contract's "mintTo" method. These methods, written in Solidity, are specifically designed for minting tokens.

It's equivalent to this Solidity function:

```solidity
@mutableAccount(mint)
@mutableAccount(tokenAccount)
@mutableSigner(mintAuthority)
function mintTo(uint64 amount) external {
    // Mint tokens to the token account
    SplToken.mint_to(
        tx.accounts.mint.key, // mint account
        tx.accounts.tokenAccount.key, // token account
        tx.accounts.mintAuthority.key, // mint authority
        amount // amount
    );
}
```

With this, the user will receive their minted tokens in their wallet.
