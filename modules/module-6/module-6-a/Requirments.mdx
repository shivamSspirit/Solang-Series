## Similarity with anchor test

Are you familiar with Anchor tests? We have detailed certain tests in Anchor for creating token mints and transferring tokens, utilizing the same RPC calls here.

## Extra state management

We are incorporating an additional layer of state and DApp scaffold to display the DApp state in the UI.

## Checkpoint-0

Verify your environment by checking the Node version. Install the Phantom extension and create a wallet. Access the settings and choose the development setting to switch the cluster to the Devnet.

## The App Dir.

Let's move on to our Next.js setup, we are utilizing the Solana DApp scaffold provided by Solana Labs. Navigate to the "app" directory within our fullstak application.

Let's delve into the "app" directory, where the DApp stack consists of Solidity, Solang, Next.js, Tailwind, Anchor, Zustand, and Solana Wallet Adapter. Our focus is on the following files:

- Contract integration
    - [idl]
    - [contracttypes]
- DApp parent state runner
    - [_app.tsx]
    - [context]
- DApp helper and user interface
    - [ui view]
    - [component]
