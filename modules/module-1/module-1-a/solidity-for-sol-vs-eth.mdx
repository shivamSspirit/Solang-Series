# Objectives

In this lesson, you'll learn:

- How to adjust Solidity for use with Solana.
- The key technical differences between Ethereum and Solana.

# Quick Summary

We'll briefly compare Solana and Ethereum's development environments. Unlike Ethereum's single-account system (handling both code and data), Solidity contracts on Solana use two accounts: one for the executable code (program account) and another for storage variables (data account).

# Overview

**Adapting Solidity for Solana**

For Solidity to work with Solana, some changes are needed. In Solana's Solidity contracts, you'll find two accounts: the program account (holding the contract's executable code) and the data account (for storage variables). This is different from Ethereum's single-account system.

### Simplifying Solana and Ethereum Technicalities

- Solana accounts use a 32-byte key (the `address` type), different from Ethereum's 20-byte address. For example, a Solana address looks like `36VtvSbE6jVGGQytYWSaDPG7uZphaxEjpJHUUpuUbq4D`, which isn't compatible with Ethereum's format like `0xE0f5206BBD039e7b0592d8918820024e2a7437b9`.
- Wallet addresses in Ethereum typically have 40 characters including the '0x' prefix, while Solana addresses are about 44 characters without a fixed prefix.
- You'll need Solana version v1.8.1 for this.
- Ethereum uses gas to manage resources in smart contracts, affecting costs. In Solana, they use compute units (200k per function), focusing on speed and not charging for these units.
- Solana doesn't have the `msg.sender` function, and because of different signature algorithms, it lacks `ecrecover()` but has `signatureVerify()` for ed25519 signatures.
- Solana doesn't support try-catch statements. If there's a failure, the transaction is stopped and reverted.
- Error handling and reverts are limited in Solana, and it's not compatible with the ERC-20 interface.

Here's a comparison table highlighting these differences:
