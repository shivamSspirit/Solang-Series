# Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Be introduced to the Solang compiler.
- Understand the process of compiling Solana programs in detail.

## tl;dr

This lesson delves into Solang, a Solidity compiler for Solana that enables the creation of Solana smart contracts using the Solidity language. Solang uses the llvm framework to generate efficient WebAssembly (WASM) or Solana SBF contract code, which helps reduce execution costs. It's compatible with Ethereum's Solidity compiler (version 0.8) and integrates seamlessly with Solana development tools like Anchor, making the development and deployment of Solana programs straightforward.

## Overview

[Solang](https://solang.readthedocs.io/) is a specialized Solidity Compiler designed to facilitate the development of Solana programs (analogous to smart contracts in other blockchain platforms) using the Solidity programming language. Utilizing the [llvm compiler framework](https://llvm.org/), Solang translates Solidity code into optimized WebAssembly (WASM) or Solana SBF contract code. This optimization leads to reduced gas costs or compute units when the contracts are executed on the Solana network.

Solang strives to maintain compatibility with Ethereum's EVM Solidity compiler, specifically version 0.8, ensuring that developers who are familiar with Ethereum's Solidity can easily transition to developing for Solana. This compatibility is a significant advantage for Ethereum developers looking to explore Solana's ecosystem.

Furthermore, Solang is designed to integrate smoothly with popular Solana development tools, such as the Anchor framework. This integration facilitates an efficient workflow for developers, enabling them to build and deploy Solana programs using Solidity in a familiar and effective environment.

In the next lesson, we will examine the differences between using Solidity for Solana and Solidity for Ethereum, providing insights into how these two blockchain platforms vary in their approach to smart contract development.
