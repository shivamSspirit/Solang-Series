# Objective

In this lesson, you will:

- Gain an understanding of developing a Solana program in Solidity using the Anchor framework.

## tl;dr

This lesson provides a case study that illustrates the differences between Solana programs and Ethereum smart contracts, focusing on their development approaches, tools, and technologies.

# Overview

In Solana, the [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) framework is a pivotal tool for developing Solana programs. The Solana platform supports a variety of programming languages, including Rust (both native and through Anchor), C, C++, and Python (via [Seahorse](https://seahorse-lang.org/)). Notably, Solidity can now be used to develop with Solana, thanks to the innovation of the Solang compiler with Solana tools. This integration makes the development of Solana programs in Solidity possible, similar to how [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) facilitate Ethereum's development process. Ethereum is known for its Solidity smart contracts, Solana has its counterpart: Solana programs.

In Solana, programs are akin to Ethereum's smart contracts but are designed to leverage Solana's unique features and architecture. These programs use the robust capabilities of the Solana blockchain, such as its high throughput and low transaction costs, to offer efficient and scalable decentralized solutions. The Anchor framework simplifies the development of these programs, providing a familiar and accessible environment for developers, especially those with a background in Ethereum and Solidity.

By understanding the nuances of developing Solana programs with Solidity, developers can efficiently transition their skills and knowledge from the Ethereum ecosystem to Solana. This exploration into the similarities and differences between the two platforms will provide a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively build and deploy decentralized applications in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.
