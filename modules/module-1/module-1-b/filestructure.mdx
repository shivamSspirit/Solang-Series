# Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Learn about the file structure used in Solidity for Solang.

## tl;dr

Solidity files, which typically have a `.sol` extension, can contain multiple contracts. However, it's a best practice to define one contract per file and name the file after the contract.

# In-Depth Look

Solidity files (`.sol`) can include more than one contract, but for clarity and organization, it's recommended to stick to one contract per file. Here's what you need to know:

- **Defining Contracts**: Use the `contract` keyword followed by the contract name. The contract's body is enclosed in curly braces `{ }`.

```solidity
contract A {
 /// foo simply returns true
 function foo() public returns (bool) {
 return true;
 }
}

contract B {
 /// bar simply returns false
 function bar() public returns (bool) {
 return false;
 }
}
```

- **Best Practices**: 
   - **Single Contract Per File**: To maintain clarity and manageability, limit each Solidity file to a single contract.
   - **File Naming**: Name the file after the contract it contains. For example, if your contract is named `MyContract`, the file should be named `MyContract.sol`.

By following these practices, your Solidity code for Solana programs becomes more readable and easier to manage, especially as your projects grow in size and complexity.
