# Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Gain an understanding of Solidity tailored for Solana development.
- Learn about the unique aspects of Solidity.
- Discover practical applications for programs developed using Solidity.

# tl;dr

This lesson introduces you to Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, adapted for Solana. Originally developed in 2015, Solidity is high-level, object-oriented, and incorporates elements from Python, C++, and JavaScript. It's a key language for creating diverse blockchain applications, from voting systems to crowdfunding platforms.

# Detailed Overview

Solidity, emerging from Ethereum, offers a range of features:

- **Smart Contract Foundation**: Solidity is designed to create smart contracts, which are integral to most blockchain platforms.
- **Inspired by Established Languages**: Its design is influenced by Python, C++, and JavaScript, making it accessible to developers from various backgrounds.
- **Support for Complex Constructs**: It supports user-defined types, libraries, and other advanced features.
- **Diverse Application Range**: Solidity enables the creation of various contracts, like voting systems, auctions, and multi-signature wallets.

**Solidity in Solang Context**:

- **Compatibility**: Solang targets compatibility with Ethereum Foundation's Solidity Compiler (version 0.8), with some exceptions.
- **Differences**:
  - Outputs WebAssembly or Solana SBF, not EVM bytecode.
  - Uses little-endian encoding for packed encoding.
  
**Key Components in Solang**:

1. File and Contract Structure
2. Imports
3. Pragmas
4. Data Types (specific to Solana, like address)
5. Constructors
6. Functions

Next, we'll delve into the File and Contract Structures of a Solidity program compiled with Solang, laying the groundwork for your Solana programming skills.
