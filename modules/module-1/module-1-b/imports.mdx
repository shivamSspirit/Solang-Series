# Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Learn how Solidity's import directive functions and how it differs from other languages.
- Explore the different types of imports in Solidity.

## tl;dr

Solidity uses the import directive to include code from other files, similar to JavaScript imports. This feature allows you to incorporate constants, structs, enums, events, functions, and contracts from external files. Unlike JavaScript, Solidity doesnâ€™t have an export statement or default export.

## Detailed Overview

**Import Directive:**

In Solidity, the import directive is used to integrate other Solidity files into your contract. For instance, importing the Solana library lets you utilize its methods within your Solidity contracts. Solidity's approach to imports is somewhat akin to JavaScript's ES6, with some differences.

Example:
```Solidity
import { foo, bar } from "defines.sol";
```

In Solidity, `import` is hoisted, allowing `foo` and `bar` to be accessible before the import statement. 

**Types of Imports:**

There are several types of imports you can use:

1. **Import Everything from a Library:**
   ```Solidity
 import "defines.sol";
   ```
   This imports all items from "defines.sol", differing from ES6 where such syntax imports nothing.

2. **Select Specific Items from a Library:**
   ```Solidity
 import { foo, bar } from "defines.sol";
   ```
   Only imports `foo` and `bar` from "defines.sol".

3. **Using Import Maps:**
   Import maps link a path segment to a specific location on the file system. For example:
   ```Solidity
 import map @openzeppelin=/opt/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts
 import "@openzeppelin/interfaces/IERC20.sol";
   ```
   This would link to `/opt/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol`.

## Renaming Imports

You can also rename imports for convenience or to avoid name clashes:

```Solidity
import { bar as baz, foo } from "defines.sol";
```

This renames `bar` to `baz` from "defines.sol".

**Grouping Imports Under a Namespace:**

```Solidity
import "defines.sol" as defs;
// Now use defs.bar, defs.foo, etc.
```

This groups all imports from "defines.sol" under the `defs` namespace.

Next, we'll delve into pragma directives in Solidity,

an essential aspect of setting up your Solidity environment for Solana programming. Pragma directives dictate compiler behaviour and compatibility, ensuring your code is interpreted correctly.
